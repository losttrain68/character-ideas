# Chaos
Chaos is a primal, universal element, like gravity. There is no evidence that it is sentient despite many who believe otherwise. Likewise, Chaos is not an oppositional force, in that it doesn't rise against order. Chaos is instead more like a wildfire in the forest. 

## Chaos Manifest
Chaos destroys, Chaos creates. Everything it touches directly is changed. Chaos is the nature of change against predictable. In complete randomness Chaos is neither *good* nor *evil*.

Widely like electricity, Chaos exists in a state prior to most sentient lifeforms being able to harness it's potential. Perhaps by it's *nature* it may never be truly *harnessed* or made to serve the whim of any particular desire.


## Cults
There are those who worship, patronize and even anthropomorphize Chaos. Like those who find faith in *nature*, they might find powerful patrons or *deities* who draw some power from true Chaos or may claim to draw power from this well, but like water or magic, True Chaos is elemental.

Traditionally, Chaos is not a thing that can be *summoned*, *imbued* or used to create other enchantment. Chaos is *wild*, even in it's most tame manifestation, it is almost beyond comprehension, by even the **most powerful** beings, be they deieties, patrons, devils or demons.


## True Champions
Chaos, while unharnessable, in it's unpredictably, Chaos manifests in actors within various forms of existence. These are not creatures who are in a mind of Chaos or are necessarily even intentional in their actions, for Chaos.

Rather these may be a species of creature so unusual, so bizarre or who act in such a manner in which their very existence defies the predictable order of things. For example, the multi-armed *Wrack* that was truly neither devil nor demon, yet has appeared under the service and has *origins* in both infernal and abysmal lore, a creature that had no true singular origin but has appeared in legends across the multiverse. From the spectacular (Wrack) to the mundane, there are creatures throughout *nature* or the *magical world* that whose existence began in Chaos: the unicorn, griffon, platypus, to name a few.

# CRAP why would champions manifest for Chaos, which is non-sentient?!?

*Life finds a way*
* Champions of Chaos are the *life forms* that are product of Chaos. *Doesn't sound quite right*

**What was the whole point of this?!?**
To have bad guys who did bad things, who may be somehow connected/or be faces of the same creature.

Ugh, maybe that's not Chaos related at all!

# $$#!$)$!! Maybe what I need is a *face of evil* that is incarnate in these champions?

# Lamlis & Corrin 

STORY | [LAMLIS](#lamlis-id) | CORRIN | CORRIN'S FAMILIAR

Corrin’s family had always revered Tiandra, The Summer Queen, a tradition bordering on religion that was passed to him by his elvish father. His mother grounded him in the ways only a good halfling can, teaching him the value of good food and good family. Both believed that Tiandra smiled on Corrin and that he was special, destined for something great.

While foraging with others from his village for herbs that only bloomed in twilight, Corrin was kidnapped into slavery by drow elves of the Underdark. All of the dark elves seemed to sense something within him that they despised and heaped abuse on Corrin for days until a young elf stepped between the halfling and the lash. What the other drow found enraging, Lamlin found fascinating. He stayed near Corrin, kept him safe from the worst work and physical threats, brought him extra rations and water which Corrin shared with slaves worse off than himself. Lamlin displayed his skill flourishing a blade in front of the slaves, performing tricks that were at first meant to display his superiority. But soon he began to simply practice his tricks and new feats in front of the captives, sometimes even asking Corrin for advice on improvement.

The dark elves arranged a slave sale and exchange with pirates. Having had enough of Corrin - and Lamlin’s softness towards the boy and increasingly combative attitude with the other drow - Corrin was selected to be sold and Lamlin chosen to be part of the escort that brought the goods to the exchange. But the pirates plan was to attack the elves and steal the slaves to increase their profit, and both Corrin and Lamlin found themselves in a ship’s hold headed toward a slaver’s market.

The pirates delighted in torturing Lamlin with sunlight and, when they felt like it, their fists before tossing him back into the hold. They never did too much outward damage because they believed he would fetch a high price at market. At night Corrin would tend to Lamlin’s wounds even though the other captives hated their former captor. “You looked after me, now let me look after you.” Corrin prayed to Tiandra for help setting himself and the others free. Lamlin swore that he would gain their freedom and revenge by any means necessary.

The ship docked at the slave port and the cargo was marched down the gangplank towards the auction block. Potential buyers who had gathered at the wharf to inspect the incoming slaves shouted angrily at the pirates and the drow. They believed that the elf would bring terrible luck, a curse from Lolth, that he had potentially infected the other slaves with some Underdark magic and that the pirates needed to get rid of him immediately. The captain unsheathed his scimitar and stepped toward Lamlin intent on killing him and saving what profit he could. But Corrin got between them and might have taken the blow himself if Tiandra hadn’t chosen to take pity and save Corrin. With barely a wave of her hand, The Summer Queen transformed the pirates into barracuda. Some of them managed to flop into the sea and live, but most asphyxiated on the dock. A nod toward the slave merchants turned them into wild pigs that ran towards town to get away from the Fey Queen. Most were eaten before week’s end. Then she turned to Corrin, Lamlin, and the other slaves.

“Your family has always shown me proper respect, and for that I have come to set you free. I have even chosen to help you unlock your true potential as a healer and set you on a path towards greatness. There is just one little thing I need from you…”

Tiandra and Corrin blinked away for just a moment to the Feywilds or the Upper Planes, and for who knows how long as time moves differently in those realms. When they returned, Corrin was dressed in finery, healed of all wounds, glowing faintly, and his eyes marked forever as having made a pact with the Summer Queen.

A moan escaped Lamlin’s throat and Tiandra finally noticed that he hadn’t run away when freed like the other slaves. She also noticed that Corrin was trying to shield Lamlin from her radiance and the bright daylight, putting himself between them and casting the dark elf in shadow. 

“You are braver than you look, handsome boy, but I would have words with this one.”

Lamlin was breathing heavily and struggling to maintain any kind of dignity in the face of this near goddess. “My queen. No fey-child, no elf or creature of any kind should be forced into slavery as we were. As my people have wrongly done for generations.” He forced the words out between gritted teeth. “Please, grant me a boon and I pledge to always protect your children from those who would make us nothing more than property. I offer anything that is mine to give you in return.”

“Bold words from one of your kind.” Tiandra mused with a slight smile. “Though I agree with you, you are not truly one of mine and I will not become anything more than your liberator this day. However…” She paused, and if one had dared look in her eyes they would have seen vast calculations, complicated strategies, and a multitude of nuanced plots and machinations considered in an instant. “…you may yet be of use. When you have gained some skill and have more to offer than just your broken body, seek me through my emissary. I know others who may have an interest in you.”

And she was gone.

Corrin gathered Lamlin and hurried him under cover and out of the sun. He healed the drow as best he could and then they both rested until nightfall.

“I cannot go back to my people. People above ground hate my kind.” Lamlin was more angry than saddened. “Where will I go? What will I do?”

“I can’t return to my home, either. Someday I might be able to explain why, but Tiandra has made it impossible. So come with me somewhere else.” Corrin put his hand on the older boy’s shoulder. “You’re an amazing swordsman. I carry the blessing of the Fey. We can make our way to lands where neither of us are known and can build a new life. Together.”

Lamlin looked at the boy’s face and, possibly for the first time in his life, felt hope. “Together.”

Years later, Lamlin would again request a boon from Tiandra using Corrin as a conduit. And though a pact was made to help free slaves and ensure the safety of elves, it was with another, colder Archfey.

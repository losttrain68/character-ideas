The goggles have different attachments and lenses that can be arranged in different formations to provide different powers. Different combinations can be learned as the wearer increases level.

Lenses require a bonus action to activate. The wearer can *deactivate* the effect simply by switching the lenses to the *off position*. 

However, the wearer must drink a pint of alcohol to change and activate a new power. If no alcohol is consumed, the wearer can use a bonus action to re-activate the previous power.

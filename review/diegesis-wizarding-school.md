# Diegesis Wizarding School

Members of the Diegesis who study magic, approach spellcraft with an almost mechanical passion, like an engineering or logic puzzle. Each spell, each type of magic is studied like a elements of a foreign language. Traditionally the Diegesis study of magic begins with the basics of the wizarding world, but that is just the beginning of exploration for the adept. Some wizard adepts/scholars will follow a path true to wizarding, embracing a more traditional school or specialization.

This school of study is devoted to unlocking the inner-connected secrets of spellcraft and the similarities and differences in underlying power behind the different sources of magic: cleric, druidic, sorcerer, warlock and wizard.

## Arcane Savant
Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy ***any*** spell into your spellbook is halved.

## Practitioner of the Arcane
Beginning at 2nd level, you can cast spells from other classes (hereafter *Arcane Spell*). You can prepare the number of spells equal to your intelligence bonus + your proficiency bonus. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Wizard and Arcane spells.

The Wizard has half the number (rounded down) and level of Arcane spell slots equal to one level lower than their current Wizard level on the Wizard table. For example a third level Wizard would have four 1st level and two 2nd level spell slots. They also have one 1st level Arcane spell slot.

>Ariel, a 5th level Diegesis Wizard (proficiency bonus: +3), with an intelligence of 16 (bonus: +3) can prepare 6 Wizard spells and up to 6 Arcane spells. 
> He has four 1st level, three 2nd level and two 3rd level Wizard spell slots.
> He has two 1st level and one 2nd level Arcane spell slots 

Beginning at second level, you can know (prepare) the same number or Arcane cantrips as you can Wizard cantrips.

## Advanced Caster
Beginning at 6th level, you have mastered the mechanics of wizardly spellcraft. Whenever you cast a Wizard spell of 1st level or higher, using a spell slot, you regain one expended Wizard spell slot of equal ore lesser value than the spell cast. You can not regain spell slots higher than 5th level. 

At tenth level, whenever you cast an Arcane spell of 1st level or higher, using a spell slot, you regain one Arcane spell slot of equal ore lesser value than the spell cast. 

## Superior Student
Beginning at 10th level, you have unearthed the intricate connection between magic and your target. If a successful saving throw would negate damage and additional damage effect of your spell, the target instead takes half damage and effect of the spell. This only applies to spells that cause damage.

## Spell Mastery (Diegesis Option)
**Starting at 14th level**, you gain ***Spell Mastery***. You have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a 1st-level Wizard or Arcane spell and a 2nd-level Wizard or Arcane spell that are in your spellbook. You can cast those spells at their lowest level without expending a spell slot when you have them prepared. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.

By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one or both of the spells you chose for different spells of the same levels.*

## Signature Spells (Diegesis Option)
At 18th level, you gain mastery over two powerful spells and can cast them with little effort. Choose two 3rd-level Wizard or Arcane spells in your spellbook as your signature spells. You always have these spells prepared, they don't count against the number of spells you have prepared, and you can cast each of them once at 3rd level without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.

## Master of the Arcane Arts
When you reach 20th level your mastery over the spells whose secrets you have unlocked has increased. You can cast the spells prepared for your *Spell Mastery* and *Signature Spells* at their highest level without expending a spell slot. You can perform this feature as many times equal to your proficiency bonus, regardless of the level of the spell you cast without adverse effect.

If you use this feature again before you finish a long rest, you take 2d12 psychic damage for each level of the spell immediately after you cast it. Each time you use this feature again before finishing a long rest, the psychic damage per spell level increases by 1d12. The damage ignores all resistance and immunities.

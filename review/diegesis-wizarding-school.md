# Diegesis Wizarding School

Members of the Diegesis who study magic, approach spellcraft with an almost mechanical passion, like an engineering or logic puzzle. Each spell, each type of magic is studied like a elements of a foreign language. Traditionally the Diegesis study of magic begins with the basics of the wizard school but that is just the beginning of the exploration. Some wizard adepts/scholars will follow a path true to wizarding, embracing a more traditional school or specialization.

This school of study is devoted to unlocking the inner-connected secrets of spellcraft and the similarities and differences in underlying power behind the various sources of magic: cleric, druidic, sorcerer, warlock and wizard.

## Arcane Savant
Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy ***any*** spell into your spellbook is halved.

## Practitioner of the Arcane
Beginning at 2nd level, you can cast spells from other classes (hereafter *Arcane Spell*). You can prepare the number of spells equal to your intelligence bonus + your proficiency bonus. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Wizard and Arcane spells.

The Wizard has half the number (rounded down) of Arcane spell slots equal to one level lower than their current Wizard level on the Wizard table. For example a third level Wizard would have four 1st level and two 2nd level spell slots. They also have one 1st level Arcane spell slot.

>Ariel, a 5th level Diegesis Wizard (proficiency bonus: +3), with an intelligence of 16 (bonus: +3) can prepare 6 Wizard spells and up to 6 Arcane spells. 
> He has four 1st level, three 2nd level and two 3rd level Wizard spell slots.
> He has two 1st level and one 2nd level Arcane spell slots 

Beginning at second level, you can know (prepare) the half the number or Arcane cantrips as you can Wizard cantrips.

## Advanced Caster
Beginning at 6th level, you have mastered the mechanics of school of magic. Whenever you cast a Wizard spell of 2nd level or higher from your chosen school of study (e.g., 
Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination, Enchantment, Evocation, Illusion, Necromancy, or Transmutation), using a spell slot, you regain one expended Wizard spell slot of equal or lesser value than the spell cast. You can not regain spell slots higher than 5th level. 

## Superior Student
Beginning at 10th level, you have unearthed the intricate connection between magic and your target. When a creature succeeds on a saving throw against a spell up to 2nd level, that would negate damage, the creature takes half the spell's damage, but suffers no additional Effect from the spell. 

## Master of the Arcane Arts
Starting at 14th level, you can increase the power of your simpler Spells. When you cast a Wizard spell of 1st through 5th Level that deals damage, you can deal maximum damage with that spell.

The first time you do so, you suffer no adverse Effect. If you use this feature again before you finish a Long Rest, you take 2d12 psychic damage for each level of the spell, immediately after you cast it. Each time you use this feature again before finishing a Long Rest, the psychic damage per Spell Level increases by 1d12. This damage ignores Resistance and immunity.

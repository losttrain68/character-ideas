# Toon Arrows
---

These weapons are really other-dimensional beings that have somehow been brought to this plane.  They hardly even resemble arrows.  They look like the shaft of an arrow attached to a small human head.  The whole thing has an unreal look to it because of its brightness and definition of color.  That and the fact that each arrow has a unique personality to it and will tell you all about itself if asked.  In order to fire these arrows, their name must be called aloud; the arrow called will then notch and fire himself.   They do not gain any to hit bonuses from strength or specialization from the firing character, only from the bow if it is magic.  Normally, only one such arrow can be fired per round.  If the character is specialized, one Toon arrow can be fired in place of two normal arrows.  After a successful hit, unless otherwise stated, the arrow will disappear with a characteristic "poof!" only to reappear in the owner's quiver two rounds later.  Due to the distance and difference between their dimension and ours, they cannot be dublicated by any means nor can they be destroyed by any means known at this time.  The cast of Toon Arrows are as follows:
 
**Black Jaques Shalaque** - Although he doesn't talk much and dresses like a pirate, he is one of the most powerful arrows.  He will come to a stop twelve feet from the intended target, whip out a big cannon, and fire, doing 5-50 points of damage to the target, and 3-30 points of damage to every one within 2" of the target.
     
**Bruce** - A master of the martial arts, Bruce works best with lots of opponents.  "So! Your kung fu is NO GOOD!!!" rings in your ears as he launches into batttle.  Percentile dice are rolled to determine how many creatures he has attacked.  This number is also the amount of damage he 
does.  If there are less creatures than the number rolled, he misses after the second attack and flies off into nearby scenery to wreak havoc among the local shrubbery.

**The Bushwacker** - Not the smartest of arrows, but he works well when there are many things in a room and you have to divide your attention.  He doesn't use any of the character's attacks to fire, but he can do no damage against anything the character has attacked or is attacking.  When called, he starts a slow, relentless journey towards his victim.  EVERYONE knows where he's going and what he's going to do.  After a round of stalking, he strikes for 1-100 points of damage. 

**Chief Bigfeather** - Even though his name is Chief Bigfeather, he yells "Geronimo!" before he shoots himself.  (We still haven't figured that one out yet.)  When he strikes, he will pull out a giant feather (don't ask me from where) and proceed to tickle the target who will laugh uncontrollably for 1-6 rounds (no saving throw).

**Moe, Larry, and Curly** - These three arrows always fire together, using up all of the archer's attacks that round, and each must roll separately to make a successful hit.  Moe will slap the victim for 1-10 points of damage, Larry will poke the creature's eyes, blinding it for 1-10 rounds, and Curly will dance around and generally do nothing (save vs. paralyzation or act as if confused).

**Mr. Ed** - Ed has a horse's head for a tip and a horse tail for fletchings (which, one would think, would make him awfully hard to shoot).  After being drawn, Ed gallops through the air at the intended target and, on a successful hit, smashes against the victim, covering him in a sticky, quick-drying glue.  This glue is similar to the substance from the wand of viscid globs, but slightly less potent.  It can still only be dissolved by alcohol but only lasts for 1 turn.  Also, if the victim is able to move normally before being hit, he is allowed a saving throw versus wands at -3, success indicating the the creature is not held, but twice slowed.  Mr. Ed is found within the Quiver of Elgrrhhpgh  and may only be called 5/day.

**Pecos Bill** - "Yeeeeehaaaaw!!!  Let's Round 'Em Up!!!" will ring in everyone's ears as he flies through the air.  On a successful hit the creature is entangled and cannot move until its dead or the owner tells Pecos to "let the little dogie go."

**Pepe** - Pepe will tell you that he is a Mexican caballero of the noblest sort.  On a successful hit, his mouth will grow to enormous proportions and bite the intended target causing 2-20 points of damage.  This number is 
doubled if the target is larger than man sized and tripled if the large creature is shot in the rear (derierre, booty, tookas, back of the front).

**Pope** - He says "Ubi caritas et amor, Deus ibi est," and then flies to do the Lord's work.  Against normal creatures, he does 1-10 points of damage (beating them about the head with his holy symbol), plus they must save versus spell at -5 or be converted to Lawful Good and love the character forever.  Against undead, he does 3-30 points of damage PLUS Pope turns and destroys as the mace of disruption (qv.).

**Teddy** - After notching, Teddy will say "I speak softly..."  Before hitting he says "...but I carry a BIG STICK!  AND I LIKE TO USE IT, TOO!!!"  He causes 4-40 points of damage with the tree trunk he produces from nowhere; double this if the creature is only affected by blunt weapons.

**Wanda** - This arrow has a smiling, ladylike fish's head for its arrowhead and fins for its fletchings.  When called, it goes nowhere, but floats alongside the character.  It confers the ability to breath underwater, free action under water, and fish telepathy.

## Helm's Path

Being in a completely unfamiliar place wasn't stressful. Being surrounded by a population made up almost entirely humans and halflings, was kind of stressful. That there seemed to be less than two hundred of them was also stressful. Finding out that he was almost two thousand years in the past, was pretty stressful too.

But being separated from the other masks, that was the part that Talib was having a hard time bearing. Like a nagging itch on the surface of your brain, just under your skull, you can feel it, you know it's there you just can't scratch it.

Talib held it together, no one knew the anxiety, the creeping, crawling, digging anxiety: knowing the other masks were in jeopardy. How long would they be gone? How will they ever get back? Will they ever get back?

There were contingency plans of course, there was a day or two leeway before the actual self-destruct mechanisms, steps taken, procured, carefully outlined and orchestrated to obliterate any possible connection between the masks and any background at all for those other lives. Sure it was expensive, but it would be worth it. Wouldn't it?

Talib focused on being helpful in the village, finding out about how and to whom they practiced their worship. Talib helped tend gardens where there was tending to be done, and helped with a well that had needed cleaning. 

While focus naturally drew back to Waterdeep, the lives, the responsibilities, there was also something liberating working the land, working in the sun. Talib thought, if it was the will of Helm, a life (maybe more than one) could be made here.

And Talib prayed and prayed. At least three times a day, Talib prayed.

It was on the fourth night, on that strange day, when Talib had gone back to the tent that had become *home* here in this ancient civilization, after a hard day's work and a joyful evening meal with new friends. Talib was almost satisfied until the thoughts of the other masks came, right before sleep.

>In the dream his knives spoke. Of course, with the voice of Helm.
*Consecrate each path to me and you shall never be lost. Look to your tools and ease your mind. One of the ornate miniature daggers appeared to float before him. The ceremonial knife twisted and spun in the air, above a small basin of a clear liquid. The tip of the blade descended and moved in a pattern, a glowing sigil that Talib recognized traced in the water. And the water first reflect the face of one of the other masks and then Talib and then something strange and wonderful and he awoke.

Desperately, with conviction, Talib unwrapped his sacred blades. Find the correct one, weighing in one hand and then rushing to the other side of the tent, where Talib's bag was in the corner. Tailb retrieved the small ceremonial basin, carried just for this purpose. Talib prayed. As calmly as possible, Talib prayed and then performed the ceremony.

Suddenly on the surface of the water was the chambers of the othre mask. As if Talib could see into the other time, into the future. There it appeared to be near midnight, if the artifacts that told time around the room were to be believed. A vision, for sure, but was it helpful?

Later that afternoon, following lunch, Talib returned to the scrying bowl and repeated the spell, expecting to see daytime, like it was here. But it wasn't, it was still midnight. As if nothing had changed. *Could it be possible*?

That night, after prayers and before retiring to bed, Talib repeated the ceremony. *Nothing had changed, again...* Talib went to bed, beginning to believe that time was somehow Force Grey had stepped in between the seconds of time. *Somehow...*

In the morning, for the fourth time Talib repeated the action and this time, saw the same thing that was there before, at apparently the same time. And Talib dared to believe...

Suddenly the vision began to disipate, the water swirling, and then erupted into a fountain. A fountain, out of the small bowl! When the water dissipated, an object remained floating in the air.

Talib could only stare in disbelief.

*Consecrate each path to me and you shall never be lost. Go forth with your virtuous mission.

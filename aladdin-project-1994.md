## The Creation Story

In the beginning there was the Spirit Goddess, and she was alone in the void, floating in the nothingness aware of nothing but herself and content in her solitude. Then she discovered the Other, and he was different from the Spirit Goddess. She was not afraid for she assumed that he was herself, or something else equally as good or as interesting.
From their union a quartet of gods came into being: the Earth God, the Air God, the Water God, and the Fire God. The Spirit Goddess smiled on her children as they played in the universe creating everything that is known. The Fire God lit the sun and the stars, the Earth God created the planets, the Water God shied away from his hot brother and covered the planets with cool oceans and rivers, the Air God flew between the planets and swirled around them and breathed the life of the Goddess into them.

The Other looked upon the works of his sons and became jealous. He believed they were trying to make themselves his equal, his better! So out of himself he created the Demon Horde - all of the vile, evil, grotesque, monstrous creatures that now and have ever walked the earth spewed forth from him and began to ravage the universe. Their only goal was to destroy and corrupt that which the gods had created. The Other looked upon the works of his creations and smiled.

The Spirit Goddess realized her folly in trusting the Other so completely and sought to undo his terrible works. She gathered unto her the lowliest of his own demons, the most servile and pathetic of his caste and gave some of herself to them, creating humanity. Bolstered by the power of the Four Gods, humanity rose up and defeated the Other and his Horde, driving them off the earth and into another realm where they now wait for the time when once again they will rule the universe.

## How the Races Came to Be

Hundreds and hundreds, upon thousands and thousands of the Other’s demons roamed the newly created earth, rending it, raping it, corrupting it and exploiting it. The four gods fought the horde, but even with the awesome powers that they possessed, they could not match the might that the Other’s horde commanded. Overwhelmed as much by sheer number as raw power, all looked bleak for the gods who had created the universe.

The brothers, their spirit broken by the raging battle, took to the heavens of space, where the Spirit Goddess consoled them. She could not allow this travesty to continue and with her careful touch reached down upon the earth. And from the very spot where she lay her celestial fingertips, creatures were birthed. Single-minded, fierce and determined,  these new beasts roamed the planet as if it were their own. While some conflicts with the demon hordes arose, most were extremely lopsided and wound up with the beasts either killed outright or enslaved. For the most part, the demon hordes ignored the new wildlife.
Finally, seeing the failure of her first trial, the Spirit Goddess bid her sons to return to the planet to re-engage the war anew. She then sought out the lowliest of all the demons - the most simple and base of all creatures created by the Other. And to these she gave her greatest gift, the touch of humanity.  Transformed by the Spirit Goddess, the demons shed their allegiance to the Other and joined arms with the brothers against their father. This new humanity was split into four very distinct off-shoots, distinguished by their habits as well as their appearances. And these became the human, dwarven, elfin and gnome races. And these became the brother’s army and eventually forced back the Other and his horde.

Eventually, the humans began to claim dominance over the plains and arable land. Dwarves took the Earth God as their own and sequestered themselves within the mountains and hills to worship the steel, the iron, and the forge. The elves became nomadic herdsmen and gypsies, their touch from the Goddess giving them the gifts of pre-sight and longevity.

## Story of the Netherworld

On the eve of their final defeat at the hands of the four gods and the newly born humanity, the Other gathered his mightiest and most cunning demons and retreated- vanishing at the brink of destruction. The Earth god combed his land- with humanity stretching across it looking for any place the Other might have gone or seeking out any demons that might be left over. The Water god threw horrible waves and terrifying currents through the oceans, to drive out the evil ones. Fire stretched out across his stars, from one end of  All that there is  to the other. And Air joined him, in the dark places beyond the world- where no stars are brave enough to travel. Still, none of the brothers could find the Other or any sign of the horde that he took with him.

Hidden away, where no one would know to look, the Other took refuge in the safest place he could find - within the very earth itself! Almost immediately he began to weave new doorways and create new frontiers- places only imaginable- he began to build his new kingdom. He created realms that mocked the other gods- a realm of fire, a realm of water, of air, and one that bore only a sick twisted resemblance to the land that surrounded his new kingdoms. And it was in this realm, that mocked the life that humanity now began to create, that the Other made his home- deep within the bowels of the world, safe from Earth,  Water, Fire, and of course- Air.
The Other’s kingdom grew and grew, strange passages from new kingdoms stretched, intertwining through the world beneath the surface. Though some realms made up worlds of their own, most were dark interpretations of the world that he was now a fugitive of.

So it came to pass, that creatures and eventually mankind began to discover passages to these realms snaking up from the Netherworld. And at long last, the brothers knew where the Other had sought his haven. The battle was rejoined anew, this time with the forces of good marching into the bowels of the Netherworld. But the Demon Horde was too well fortified in their homes, and turned back the army of light.

Defeated, the brothers resolved that if they could not wrest the villain from his safehole, then neither shall he leave it freely of his own will. And the world became the staunch walls of the Other’s prison. Beneath the surface, his kingdom stretches as endlessly as the celestial heavens, but to all of his great power in his own realm, he is powerless to escape it- lest he suffer the wrath of the brothers who eagerly await his return...

## How Things Would Work

As detailed above, there are only six true gods. The Spirit Goddess is considered the ultimate good and all-encompassing. The Other is considered ultimate evil, ruler of and trapped within some nether realm. The four elemental gods are all neutral in their temperament - Earth and Water tending towards order, Fire and Air tending towards chaos. Other creatures of power are considered demi-gods, saints, or heroes, and though worshipped with fervor, are known to not to be gods. Death is considered an extension of the Other’s power and is feared and hated.

Humanity believes itself to be part Goddess, part demon. Their ultimate goal is to do enough good in their lifetime, accumulate enough of the Goddess within themselves so that they become one with her when they die. If they still have not attained this perfection at the time of death, they believe they are reincarnated in order to try again. Bodies of the dead are committed to the god of their region - either buried in the earth, buried at sea, consumed on a flaming pyre, tossed into a mist-filled ravine, or some combination of these.

Most everyone is good, although evil humans do exist. They are thought to have given themselves over to their demonic nature and can be exterminated with impunity. Undead zombies, vampires, and the like are thought to be humans who gave themselves wholly to their demonic selves, were refused the gift of reincarnation and refused entrance into the Other’s nether-realm for abandoning the Horde in the beginning of things.

Sorcerous magick is considered to be making use of one’s demonic side to warp or force natural forces to do your bidding. Thus, the motives and alignment of magicians and sorcerers are always suspect. Powerful good sorcerers are rare. Evil magicians abound. Clerical or healing magick is thought to be an extension of the Spirit Goddess within the person. The priest entreats nature to aid him or her and nature responds in accordance to their goodness. Because they have the power of the gods on their side, clerics tend to outlast and become more powerful than most magicians. Gods are invoked for both kinds of magick depending on the caster’s geographical upbringing: some would ask for the swiftness of the wind and others the speed of rushing wildfire, some would ask for the invisibility of the air and others the quiet of the earth, some would ask for the strength of the stone and others the power of the ocean.

## The Adversary

The Netherworld is the equivalent to all of the Hells, the Abyss’, Hades, etc. It also makes up much of the other “planes” that one might venture into. For example, it is possible that humans (and whatever) might have actually gotten trapped (or misled) into a region of the Netherworld, where they live thinking they are somewhere else. Conduits into the Netherworld exist all over, in various shapes and sizes. Most commonly, they are natural formations that have been corrupted from down below or are artifacts of some kind that have been enchanted to open a portal into a specific region.

The Other is not powerless on the Earth, but does not often move his physical body out of the Netherworld. Instead, he chooses to send up minions of his horde to do his bidding. Occasionally, he might intervene with some power of his own, but will almost never leave the Netherworld.


## Some Possible Game Scenarios

There are on the world true elements - fire, rock, water, and air taken from the bodies of the gods themselves. Legend holds that the one who brings all four elements together shall have power enough to rule the universe. Everyone is scrambling to gain possession of them, men and demi-men and demons alike.

or…

Demons are spilling onto the earth through holes into the Netherworld and 'heroes must come up with a way to stop up the holes and protect themselves from the Other’s sons and daughters.

or…

Armageddon (or what passes for it in this world) is coming with all the appropriate signs - demons are coming out to play, natural orders are in upheaval, and so on. The four true elements could come into play again to reset the cycle and the heroes must come up with a way to live through all this.

or…

Some Queen/Princess/Key-personality is kidnapped by the Other’s minions for the purpose of opening a large gateway onto the earth and the heroes must travel to the Netherworld to rescue her and stop the Other.

## The Basic Worldview

Before life begins is born on Earth, is exists in the “Well of Life”. All spirit forces reside there before they begin and sometimes briefly after they end their existence on the waking planet. Standing guard at the Well is Marth. It is his sworn duty to safeguard the *new born* and returning energies still in the Well.

It is said that the universe always existed as it was found by those who have recorded their experiences for the rest of us. There has always been a Well, an Earth, a Hell, and a Bliss. It is said that the first three born to this world (giants, 2 men and a woman) lived there for aeons, roaming the world, discovering all that there was to know and perfecting themselves. They were born to different parts of the planet and did not know of each other until they all happened to climb the same mountain at the same time. One was overcome with lust, one with revulsion, one with self-realization and loathing (although we may never know which giant felt which). They all destroyed each other and found themselves placed at the gateways to the Otherworlds, each chained to his station by an unbreakable leash until the Well is emptied, Hell becomes full to overflowing, and the universe collapses in upon itself.

The spirit force is born unto the Earth and a new life begins - a lifetime of adventure and discovery, of searching and realization, a new quest for the promise of the Realm of Eternal Bliss. To each person this sacred goal is different. While some will choose to follow devoted orders and rigorously maintained disciplines, others will seek their nirvana. through the accumulation of personal power or helping others. Most will just try to survive as best they can, leaving the adventure to others.
There, among the three world nations and dozens of city-states the lone individual is cast, to find that which only he seeks - his perfect life - the truth behind his existence. Evil and good are more subjective than truly defined. Laws govern life within territorial boundaries, but more so than not each person follows his own beliefs before any of those imposed upon him, because where one goes after death is known, but how one assures his place in any of the realms is unknown.

## Classes of People

**Warrior • Monk • Zealot • Sorcerer**

**The Warrior** believes that the only way to achieve Bliss is to become the perfect warrior: unstoppable, invulnerable to attack, pure in heart and unwavering in purpose (whatever that may be), as was the warrior Giant. He will serve a Lord as long as the Lord asks of him suitably difficult tasks and does not ask him to sway from his true purpose. For him or her, there is no higher power than his own conscience.

**The Monk** believes that Bliss is attained by following the strictest codes of behavior and study, by spending one’s time on earth doing as little harm as possible, and by performing acts of goodness and self-sacrifice whenever called upon to do so. The Monk learns through study of the Holy Tome how to channel his own energies to heal and sway others around him or her to the good. A member of this caste will never fight to kill, only to subdue and stun. The only time lethal violence is tolerated is when fighting demonkind, for they have already fallen and cannot be saved. Followers of this order are considered blessed by all, even those who do not agree with their choice of lifestyle, and are considered bad luck to kill.

**The Zealot** believes that the universe wasn’t always the way it is now, that is was created. Members of this cult worship the OneGod, who set all things in motion, who cursed the giants for their disregard for life, who decides whether or not a man reaches Bliss. They are not well-received by the general populace and have learned from Warriors how to defend themselves. They, too, have a strict code of behavior that includes charity and self-sacrifice and punishment of the evil. They are more liberal with their violence, believing that when the OneGod sorts things out they will be in the right.

**The Sorcerer** has learned to manipulate the currents of power that stretch across the world from one Netherealm to the other, and uses this knowledge to create magickal effects. These people often give up any hope of entering Bliss and opt for eternal life instead, where they know they will have power and control. Power is the ultimate dictator of their life’s direction. The loss of this control that could come with Bliss is anathema to them.

# Other Worlds

## Nature-oriented

A fearful humanity developed in the shadow of the animals who seemed to be far more powerful, wise, and better adapted to survival. They created a mythology for themselves that acknowledged the animals’ superiority - gave them a god’s status. As humanity grew more civilized and created new technologies, their gods grew more and more human-like while never “losing their heads.” Their spheres of influence expanded to include conceptual as well as physical realms. They are said to live in a castle on a mountain-top.

Some of the gods could be as follows:
•	**Eagle-head**: All-Father/Sky-Father
•	**Ram-Head**: Mountain/Thunder God
•	**Cat-Head**: Keeper of Mysteries
•	**Serpent-Armed**: Earth-Mother/Wisdom-Giver
•	**Tiger/Raven/Vermin-Headed**: Triple god or oracle
•	**Pig-Headed**: Fertility Goddess
•	**Bear-Headed**: Forest/Nature God
•	**Wolf/Dog/Jackal/Canine**: Headed	Death God

Non-humanoid races are rarely in direct contact with humans and are often considered the figments of imagination or stuff of tales, rather than beings who exist in this reality. Most are just trying to keep out of humanity’s way as it grows ever outward. Others are openly hostile.

Possible game scenarios…

The followers of one god are warring against everyone else.

or…

One or more demi-human race are warring against humanity.

or…

Gods have come to earth and are causing havoc.

or…

Animals are getting fed up with people and are on the warpath.

or…

The game is set towards the beginning of man’s development. The gods have no human attributes other than speech. People are just beginning to figure out fire and spears. Primitivism abounds. Tribes at war.

## Post-Apocalpytic

This is set in the far future where all remnants of 20th Century life are but decaying icons - suitable only for worship or disregard. Humanity managed to survive whatever caused this wipeout of society, but not without a few changes. Dwarves, elves, hobgoblins, and other demi-humans and monsters now exist thanks to mutation. Reality works in entirely new ways and magick and sword are king.

There is a shrine built around the broken Statue of Liberty to worship the Armless Star Goddess. The Gateway in St. Louis is now a portal of transportation that can take you to anywhere on earth, for a price. The Grand Canyon has grown to almost sever the west from the east, and is ruled by the WildPak - elves with an attitude and no tolerance for trespassers. The Egyptian Pyramids often cruise by overhead and take people for examination, experimentation, and extermination.

# Big Brother 

A young boy whose parents were once makers of House Cannith became an orphan when they were killed for their transgressive artificing. They fled the capitol and had made it all the way to The Mournland before being found and murdered, though they managed to hide their child, Ariki, from the hunters' detection. Left to his own devices, Ariki found it profitable to scavenge The Mournlands and sell what he discovered on the black market.

It was there that he came across a deactivated warforged soldier in near-pristine condition. Somehow his Dragonmark was able to reanimate the juggernaut, though the creature was unable to recall who he fought for in the Great War or how he came to lie where he was found. Ariki adopted the soldier, named him Big Brother and the two have been inseparable since. Big Brother is absolutely devoted to "Master Ariki" and at all times seeks to protect him from harm. Because the warforged giant is far from stealthy, Ariki frequently must ask him to stay behind while the boy goes off to do something sneaky. This causes Big Brother great distress, sometimes to the point he will ignore the command to stay put so he can follow and protect.

Not long after, while on another scavenging adventure, they found a small metal chest that had been fused shut from heat (or something else non-magical). Big Brother broke it up and discovered a leather sack with a flaming skull inside. Presumably once the servant of a great sorcerer, all memory of its former life and purpose were wiped away by the magical cataclysm of The Mourning. Continuing his tradition of adopting lost creatures, Ariki named the skull Meemaw and convinced her to travel with him while her memories returned. Meemaw is kindly towards the boy and his other companions, often telling stories at bedtime by the glow of her own fiery eyes that may or may not be her own memories, or even true. Whiskers, Ariki's pet rat, likes to curl up in the warmth of her cranial cavity to sleep. She is content to stay inside her sack until needed. Who knows how long she was in the chest; a day or so in a dark sack isn't so bad. Rather than learning new spells and abilities, Meemaw is slowly remembering what was lost. Big Brother is worried what Meemaw will be like when she recovers all of her memories, though Ariki is unconcerned.

If first encountered in the wild, the group is likely on their way out to scavenge or on their way back to a city to sell their loot. If found in a city, they may be looking for a fence who can sell their loot or are living as well as their current influx of money will allow. Either way, Meemaw will be hidden in her sack until Ariki is either assured he can trust the party or thinks they are a threat she should help eliminate.

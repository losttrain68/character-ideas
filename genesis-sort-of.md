# GENESIS, *if you will*

  1.  In the beginning there was Light and Land. And the darkness.
 
  2.  Light was everywhere and touched everything, filling all that they touched with life and love. The Sister, Land, was vast and fertile, rich with abundance. But the darkness was, as it so often is, hidden.

  3.  Jealous, the darkness became furioius, denied the joy of being in the light, and killed The Sister. Fueled by rage and envy, the darkness lashed out and struck down Land. As The Sister fell, the ground shook and mountains rose: giant into the sky. Fissures struck all around and the seas became wild and turbulent. Where once there was only peace and harmony, as Land fell, the sea raged, the winds soard and nature went wild: chaos reigned.

  4.  And so it was that darkness came into the world stoking discord and filling the spaces where light could no longer go: the cracks and crevices, every nook and cavern. Where once the brilliant sky and sea were separated only by the horizon, now the sea also fell dark and full of menace. Even the sky itself became unweildly, storms crashing through the serenity for the first time.

  5.  So great was Light's Vast Sorrow. They tried to use their powers, bombardingthe ground and the sea, trying to save The Sister.

  6.  The Vast Sorrow brought about new life, born from the body of Land, the new peoples came forth. Of different shapes and sizes, born of the many different elements and animals that were Land. Vast and disparate, the people were spread all throughout the world.

  7.   In anger and rejoyce, the darkness felt the Vast Sorrow and could sense weakness and opportunity. Again lashing out, this time towards Light, the darkness filled the sky and corrupted and remade many new new life forms in his own image in the attack.
  
  8.   A brutal war between Light and the darkness waged, as the Sister poured... drained the last of your being into the very ground and the creatures of the battle. From the war that shook and formed the world, from the powers of the three Primal gods, new Elemental titans emerged. Forces of nature in their own right, these Elementals were forged from the powers of one or more of the Primal gods, created into the gods that would shape the world and those peoples who were also born from the darkness' fatal blow.

  9.  Thus began the eternal conflict between Light and Land versus the unyielding darkness. Not content to capture half of the sky and the underlight, the darkness and his indomitable will and dark champions fight with fury and cunning: in great battles across the land and within the hearts of men.


In the beginning there is the planet, flora and fauna and dinosaurs. Because dinosaurs.

There are three ***Primal gods***: Light, Land and the darkness. *I'm not sold any of the names*. Unable to come out in the light, the darkness kills Land and with her death, the world is transformed from an *Elysian field* into a world with landscape and all other geographic features. Also the beginning of *humanoid* life starts. In an attempt to save their *Sister*, Light sends down his power (***the Vast Sorrow***), which cannot save her life, but finishes bringing life to all the rest of the people of the planet.

Angered by attempt and joyous because he both killed Land and upset Light, the darkness is emboldened and attacks Light. Pouring himself out into the prime material plane, he infiltrates all the places that are dark in the world (e.g., caves, under things, etc.) and into some of the newly formed creatures. This is where monsters and how people become textured with those pesky alignments.

Land threw the last of her being into the world, trying to stop the darkness. Light and the darkness raged a fierce indescribable battle. In this cacophany, nine ***Elemental*** gods were created. Powers from one or more than one of the *Primal gods* imbued these creatures with enormous powers. And they battled and they battled. While there were a few who were tied directly to one of the *Primals* many of them were *hybrid* and allegiances shifted as time wore on. 

And ***this is where the rest of the pantheon comes in, but I'm stuck***!!!

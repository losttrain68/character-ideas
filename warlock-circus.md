### The Fantastical

Usually held near midday, The Warlock Circus Fantastical is a favorite of children and those who may not have heard of the circus before. In addition to concession stands with food and easy-to-win games, there's a petting zoo with small unusual creatures children can interact with. The Fantastical show itself features clowns whose makeup and costumes seem to change while they perform, tumblers and acrobate who not only fly through the air but vanish and reappear. The main attraction is a kindly older gnome who summons multiple never-before-seen creatures that make lights, sounds (fart noises), and stage a mock battle. The gnome encourages the audience to appload for their favorite, and the winner of the battle is usually the one with the loudest following.

### The Spectacular

Beginning at dusk, The Warlock Circus Spectacular draws an older crowd of teens and adults. Games are more difficult, more alcohol is served at the stands, and adorable creatures have been replaced with peculiarities and freaks. Instead of the petting zoo, patrons can purchase a ticket to see an evening performer up close... sometimes dangerously close. The Spectacular show features rotating acts including a (mostly) tame mimic that volunteers try to pick from an array of mundane objects by tapping on them with a raw turkey leg, and a drow whose sword, flashing in the twilight, comes within a hair's breadth of slicing open his assistant - and the audience.

### The Fantasmagoria

At midnight, the Warlock Circus Fantasmagoria begin. The games are shuttered, the food stands are closed, the bright lanterns are put out and only dim candles that never burn down light patrons' way to the tent. This show is for thrill-seekers, for men and women trying to prove their bravery in the face of evil, for the jaded no longer amused by things found in this world. In the center of the tent are three rings, each containing runes and sigils (often in what looks like blood) that let the audience know something dangerous is coming. Can you control yourself when a tabaxi consorts with her familiar and explores the limits of pleasure and pain? Will you keep your food down when a live animal is fed to a demon that appears to be nothing but mouths? Will you retain your sanity when the youngest of Old Ones whispers? Will you run home, run away, or join the circus?

# The Warlock Circus

Led by clowns and acrobats, the caravan of **The Warlock Circus** has come to town with the promise of entertainment spiced with a little bit of danger. Your mother might have gone as a girl and remembers it fondly. Your uncle might have gone and told you tales of the wondrous shows at twilight. But some have a grandparent who locks themself in their room and refuses to come out until the circus has left, while others have friends that ran away with the troupe, never to return. For the most part, the arrival is seen as a good thing, a welcome reprieve from the drudgery of life and exciting opportunity to experience real magic.

## Shows and Atractions

Tickets are available for purchase that allow customers to play carnival games throughout the day. Food stands sell fare both sweet and savory, local and exotic. But what people really come to see are the three shows performed by the Circus: **The Fantastical, The Spectacular, and The Fantasmagoria.** The Fantastical and The Spectacular are held daily, though the performers may change each time. The Fantasmagoria is only performed "when signs and omens portend that the time is right," sometimes only once per location.

### The Fantastical

Usually held near midday, **The Warlock Circus Fantastical** is a favorite of children and those who may not have heard of the circus before. In addition to concession stands with food and easy-to-win games, there's a petting zoo with small unusual creatures children can interact with. The Fantastical show itself features clowns whose makeup and costumes seem to change while they perform, tumblers and acrobate who not only fly through the air but vanish and reappear. The main attraction is a kindly older gnome who summons multiple never-before-seen creatures that make lights, sounds (fart noises), and stage a mock battle. The gnome encourages the audience to appload for their favorite, and the winner of the battle is usually the one with the loudest following.

### The Spectacular

Beginning at dusk, **The Warlock Circus Spectacular** draws an older crowd of teens and adults. Games are more difficult, more alcohol is served at the stands, and adorable creatures have been replaced with peculiarities and freaks. Instead of the petting zoo, patrons can purchase a ticket to see an evening performer up close... sometimes dangerously close. The Spectacular show features rotating acts including a (mostly) tame mimic that volunteers try to pick from an array of mundane objects by tapping on them with a raw turkey leg, and a drow whose sword, flashing in the twilight, comes within a hair's breadth of slicing open his assistant - and the audience.

### The Fantasmagoria

At midnight, **The Warlock Circus Fantasmagoria** begins. The games are shuttered, the food stands are closed, the bright lanterns are dimmed and only flickering candles that never burn down light patrons' way to the tent. This show is for thrill-seekers, for men and women trying to prove their bravery in the face of evil, for the jaded no longer amused by things found in this world. The sights to be seen have only been whispered about, the subjects of tall tales from adventurers and nightmares you thought weren't real. In the center of the tent are three rings, each containing runes and sigils (often in what looks like blood) that let the audience know something dangerous is coming. Can you control yourself when a tabaxi consorts with her familiar and explores the limits of pleasure and pain? Will you keep your food down when a live animal is fed to a demon that appears to be nothing but mouths? Will you retain your sanity when the Ringmaster calls forth the youngest of Old Ones and it whispers just for you? Will you run home, run away, or join the circus? What is known is that you have never seen anything like it before, and often pray that you never do again.

## The Circus' True Intent

The circus generally sets up outside of larger towns and cities for anywhere from a week to a few months. It's clear that half of the people who work at the circus are using it as a cover for other agendas. What's less clear are their goals. Arcane practitioners have noted that, in addition to the three summoning circles within the main arena, the tent itself sits within a larger runed circle. It is explained as an added precaution and safeguard for the community, but some have their doubts. The circus always transforms the towns it visits - sometimes in subtle ways and sometimes dramatically. While the world is harsh and death always nearby, an uptick in accidents and disappearances are often noticed. All are easily explained away and not even the storied City Watch of Waterdeep has been able to prove that the circus was responsible for wrongdoing. What's undeniable is that people are funneled and enticed toward attending The Fantasmagoria.

## The Circus Performers and Crew

## The Clowns

These guys know exactly what's really going on and are helping the Ringmaster directly.

## The Acrobats

These people are a distraction, but are highly skilled.

### The Summoning Master

**Poke the Summoning Master**, like many gnomes, is genuinely delighted by children and takes pleasure in entertaining with his magical skills. It's unclear if the wizened gnome is in denial about the Ringmaster, if he's in thrall to him, or if he is a willing partner who benefits from the dark goings on.

### The Mimic Wrangler

In addition to his mimic, he is in charge of the care of all the livestock and petting zoo animals brought along with the circus. Though not evil, he has smiled a little too broadly when someone loses a finger (or more) in her game that's a mix of *Duck-Duck-Goose* and *Whack-a-Mole*. There's a reason volunteers sign a waiver and healers are on standby.

### The Blade Spinner

[Lamlis and Corrin.](https://github.com/losttrain68/character-ideas/blob/main/lamlis-corrin.md#lamlis--corrin) This character and his partner are the whole reason I had to create the stupid circus.
